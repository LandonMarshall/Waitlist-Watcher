# Waitlist-Watcher
A basic GUI to aid UVIC students in finding a seat in a course.

# Usage
After cloning the repo, navigate to the .../Waitlist-Watcher/ and run the command
``` commandline
python -m .
```
This will launch a GUI that will allow you to choose which course, and optionally
to have the program watch for an opening, and send you an email should one appear.
